    <h1><strong><center><em>The butterflies we may never see again in Britain</em></center></strong></h1> 
    <center><p><strong> <em>If you want to catch sight of many of Britain's butterflies, you'll need to be quick.</em></strong></p>  
        <p> <em>A report by Butterfly Conservation warns that 24 of 58 species may soon disappear from our shores. <br> 
            Five more species are threatened with dying out than when the charity last compiled a Red List, 11 years ago. <br> 
            Humans are driving the loss of butterflies by destroying wildlife rich habitats, says Head of Science for Butterfly Conservation Dr Richard Fox. <br>
            <br> "They've literally been destroyed, been ploughed up, covered in fertilisers and used to grow crops or for housing," he told BBC News. <br>
            <br> But there is some hope. Several species have been brought back from the brink by intense conservation work.
